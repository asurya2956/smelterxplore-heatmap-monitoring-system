## Usage Guide

### Initial Setup
1. The application automatically generates 50 sample data points for each processing location
2. Data is stored in browser local storage for persistence
3. All features are fully functional without external dependencies

### Dashboard Navigation
- **Home**: Overview of all processing locations with heatmap visualization
- **Reports**: Add new samples and export data in CSV/JSON formats
- **Locations**: Detailed view of individual processing locations
- **History**: Filter historical data by date range
- **Alerts**: Monitor quality deviations and critical alerts
- **Analytics**: Advanced charts and performance metrics
- **Settings**: Configure application preferences

### Data Management
- **Adding Samples**: Use the Reports page to add new quality samples
- **Export Data**: Export complete datasets in CSV or JSON format
- **Clear Data**: Reset all sample data from Settings page

## Data Structure

Each quality sample contains:
- Sample ID (unique identifier)
- Processing location reference
- Quality value with unit
- Status (PASS/WARNING/FAIL)
- Timestamp
- Operator information
- Batch number
- Test method
- Additional notes

## Heatmap Color Coding

- **Green (#22c55e)**: Excellent quality (within 20% of target)
- **Yellow (#eab308)**: Good quality (within 50% of target)
- **Orange (#f97316)**: Warning quality (within 80% of target)
- **Red (#ef4444)**: Critical quality (beyond acceptable range)
